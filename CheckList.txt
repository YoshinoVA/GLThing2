1. Getting objects to draw on-screen -> load/draw multiple FBX files
2. Texturing (diffuse map) (check)
3. Lighting 	      -> Phong Shading (Specular(DOESN'T WORK YET))
4. Advanced Texturing -> Normal Mapping
5. Shadows		      -> Get shadows lined up
  a. Render Targets (check)
  b. Post-Process (check)
  c. Shadows
6. Deferred Rendering w/ all of the above
7. Camera Movement

-------------------------------------------------

1. Get an object drawing (e.g. Soulspear) (check)
2. Get a floor drawing beneath it (e.g. Soulspear with a quad)
3. Try to get the shadow to cast onto the floor (!!!)
  a. Make sure that the shadow map exists (check this in NSight)
  b. Send the shadow map into the fragment shader for lighting purposes
  c. Enjoy the shadows!
4. Make the light dynamic by rotating its direction

-------------------------------------------------

Replaced loc code with simpler equations so I only have to do it once

Can load multiple images

Can load multiple shaders
